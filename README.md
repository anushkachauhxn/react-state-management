# ðŸ¥‘ Recoil State Management

Recoil has two main concepts: **atoms** and **selectors**.

- Atoms are individual values that we want to store in the Recoil state.
- Selectors take the fundamental values expressed as atoms and transform them in some way or combine them into another value.

_Note:_ All the components within recoil will share this state. It is useful in many scenarios but could be problematic in others.

```
npm install recoil
```

### Creating Recoil State

- **Atoms** are functions that we can use to create new pieces of the Recoil state.

```js
const counterState = atom({
  key: "counterState",
  default: 0,
});
```

### Using Recoil State

Wrap the components in `<RecoilRoot>` and then access the state in any of those components using:

- `useRecoilValue` hook: to access a particular state value.

```js
const numberOfClicks = useRecoilValue(counterState);
```

- `useRecoilState` hook: to access and modify a particular state value.

```js
const [numberOfClicks, setNumberOfClicks] = useRecoilState(counterState);
```

### Using Selectors

**Selectors** allow us to define certain logic in one spot. Instead of defining the logic in multiple components, we can use a selector instead.

```js
const numberOfClicksSelector = selector({
  key: "numberOfClicksSelector",
  get: ({ get }) => {
    // get currrent data from a recoil state
    const clicksData = get(counterState);

    // return a modified value
    const numberOfClicks = clicksData.reduce((sum, clickData) => {
      return sum + clickData.amount;
    }, 0);
    return numberOfClicks;
  },
});
```

Access the modified value in any of those components using `useRecoilValue` hook.
